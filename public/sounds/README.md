# Ambient Sound Files

Place your ambient sound MP3 files in this directory:

- `rain.mp3` - Rain sounds
- `ocean.mp3` - Ocean waves
- `forest.mp3` - Forest/nature sounds
- `cafe.mp3` - Café ambiance
- `whitenoise.mp3` - White noise

## Where to Get Audio Files

You can find free ambient sounds at:

- [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

- [YouTube Audio Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary)

## File Requirements

- Format: MP3
- Recommended: 3-5 minute loops
- Quality: 128-192 kbps is sufficient
- Make sure files loop smoothly

## Testing Without Audio Files

The player will work even without audio files - it just won't play sound. The UI will function normally for testing.
